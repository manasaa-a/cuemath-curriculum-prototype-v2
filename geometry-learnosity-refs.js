//
// DEVIATION FROM THE ALGEBRA 1 TEMPLATE: Geometry's API pull (apparently
// inherited from CBSE-origin content) very often bundles several LEARNING
// worksheets (W01/W02/W03...) under one API lesson node, and sometimes our
// one lesson's content is genuinely split across two *different* API lesson
// nodes rather than sheets within one. Where picking a single ref would be
// less honest than showing the real set, cw/hw are ARRAYS of refs (same
// index across cw/hw) instead of single strings. A few lessons also have a
// LEARNING sheet but no TARGET_PRACTICE/PRACTICE sheet in the pull at all --
// those show hw: null with a comment, not a fabricated ref.
